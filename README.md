# hdp - Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (or Hierarichical LDA)

The `hdp` package provides tools to set-up and train a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) for topic modeling. This is similar to a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, with one major difference -  HDPs are non-parametric in that the topics are learned from the data rather than user-specified.
