    "In this report, we implement a Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) algorithm in Python based on Yee Why Teh et al's 2005 methods paper. The algorithm uses the Chinese Restaurant Franchise construction for its implementation. Further, code optimization was sought to improve the inference and text preprocessing speeds. Optimization tasks achieved a 30-40% in run-time compared to initial versions of the algorithm. A set of 622 scientific paper abstracts were used infer topics with the HPD algorithm and performance was assessed via a perplexity score. Further, the algorithm was compared to existing package implementations in `gensim` and similar methods such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).\n",

    "### i) Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into details on HDP, it is helpful to provide some general background on topic modeling and related methods.  Topic modeling refers to the set of unsupervised techniques used to analyze text data in documents (corpus) and determine clusters of words (topics). These methods are commonly implemented in settings requiring grouping documents based on text similarity or exploring non-apparent trends in text data. For example, auto-tagging customer support tickets based the textual similarity to previous tickets or gathering underlying trends from open-ended questions in customer feedback that could inform product features. Therefore, common results from topic modeling include 1) a set of topics and 2) a set of documents grouped by topics. However, it is important to note that these methods treat text data in a bag-of-words representation which ignores syntactic and semantic information. Similarly, they require lots of high-quality data (i.e. pre-cleaned text) for them to be most effective. \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand HPDs, it is important to start with a general understanding of base topic modeling algorithms such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).$^{2,3}$ These methods have two main underlying assumptions when it comes to modeling text. The first is that similar topics will use similar words (i.e. each topic will have a distribution over words), and the second is that documents talk about multiple topics (i.e. document can be thought as a mixture of topics). However, there exists one main difference between LSA and LDA. LSA doesn’t assume topics are distributed according to a specific distribution, while LDA offers a probabilistic approach and assumes the topics are Dirichlet distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a plate representation of an LDA model. Here $D$ is a set of documents and $N$ is the number of words within each document. The main idea is that for each document $d$ we have a set of topics ($\\theta_d$) and we assigns topics($z_{d,n}$) to those words ($w_{d,n}$). The parameter $\\alpha$ controls how many topics are assigned to documents, while $\\eta$ controls how many words are assigned to topic\n",

    "Dirichlet Process Mixtures (DPMs) can be thought of as an extension to LDA in that, instead of predefining topics, these are inferred from the data (non-parametric) and can be thought as coming from an infinite distribution of topics. This last statement is only possible due thanks to something called Dirichlet Processes (DPs). \n",

    "In simpler terms, this generates a discrete distribution that is considered \"infinite\". This infinitely discrete property arises from first generating samples from a continuous base distribution (e.g. a Gaussian), which can take an infinite number of forms, before these are realized as discrete when we assign weights to these samples. The result is an infinitely discrete distribution that follows a Dirichlet distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the diagram below shows $G$ (light blue) samples generated via a Dirichlet Process with parameters $\\alpha$ (think about this as weights) and $G_0$ (a continuous base distribution, e.g. a Gaussian). In other words, the $G$ is made up of \"countably infinite\" samples generated from weighted Gaussian samples from $G_0$ (red) and weights defined by $\\alpha$.\n",

    "\n",
    "A common, and sometimes helpful analogy, to DPMs is that of a Chinese Restaurant Process. We imagine a restaurant that serves dishes (topics) from an infinite menu (set of topics) and has space for infinite tables (word clusters). Each table can only be served one dish from the menu, but dishes can be repeated among tables. Customers (words) are then seated with certain probability on either an occupied or a new table. The diagram below shows a depiction of this process. The parameter $\\phi_{k,t}$ on each table represents a topic-table ($k,t$ are topic and table indexes), and the customers represent the words. When a new customer (word) appears, it seated in either on a new or existing table. These decision are based on probabilities proportional to number of seated customers per table ($N$), overall customers seated, and the concentration parameter $\\alpha$. \n",

    "The script's goals was to preprocess the abstract text data and produce a data structure ready-to-use for the inference functions as described on the previous section. The output structure would be a set of lists, each for a document, containing the words from the shared vocabulary appearing on each document. To simplify the inference, words from the vocabulary were coded with unique ids. \n",
    "\n",
    "After profiling the script, most time was spent on the lemmatization and stemming steps using the `nltk` package, followed by the word frequency and filtering processes to generate the shared vocabulary and inference-ready data structure. Given the steps for lemmatization/stemming are involved and the `nltk` package provides easy-to-use methods, we focused our optimization on the second most time consuming processing - constructing word frequencies, filtering and generating the data objects required for inference.\n",

    "These processes were optimized with custom C++ code `hdp_preproc.cpp` that leveraged `STL` containers and `Eigen` C++ library, and used `pybind11` to wrap it for Python use. We first optimized the word frequency and filtering methods, followed by some optimizations on text preprocessing steps (e.g. removing punctuations). \n",

After profiling the script, most of the time was spent sampling from the posterior distributions for both `k` and `t` as well as obtaining posterior multinomial random samples. \n",

The largest increase in speed came from the `sample_k` function since it required to computes the explicit posterior for a Dirichlet-Multinomial distribution. Similarly, the `numpy` multinomial random sampling was optimized with custom C++ code based on a conditional binomial sampling method referenced in the `GNU` scientific library package.\n",

    "One popular way to evaluate the fit of a topic model, both for hierarchical topic models and for standard topic models where the number of topics is set as a hyperparameter, is by measuring the perplexity of the model on a given data set.  Topic model perplexity evaluates the fit of a model using two distributions returned by the model: the distribution of words across topics and the distribution of topics within documents.  Namely, if the likelihood of a word being assigned to a given topic is high, and the probability that that topic will appear within a document is also high, this will improve the fit of the model according to the perplexity metric.  Perplexity is positive number that indicates better fit through smaller values and is defined by the following equation."
